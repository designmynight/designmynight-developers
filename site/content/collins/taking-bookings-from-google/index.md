## Taking reservations from Google

If you have access to your venue's Google Business Account, you are able to add your Collins booking URL to your Google listing. This way customers will be able to directly make a booking from Google. 

## How to set up a Reservations URL

To add a reservations URL to your Google My Business listing:

1. Sign in to [Google My Business](https://www.google.co.uk/business/?gmbsrc=gb-en_GB-et-gs-z-gmb-l-z-h~my%7Credirect%7Cu&ppsrc=GMBLR&utm_campaign=gb-en_GB-et-gs-z-gmb-l-z-h~my%7Credirect%7Cu&utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=et)
2. Choose the listing that you want to edit. (If you're using card view, you'll need to click **Manage Location**, then click **Info** from the menu.)
3. Click on the **URLs** section. 
4. For the **Reservations URL**, enter the URL to the reservations page on your website or the [Collins Booking URL for your venue](http://developers.designmynight.com/collins/booking-url/#booking-url-for-a-specific-venue). This way you will **not** be charged for any bookings.
