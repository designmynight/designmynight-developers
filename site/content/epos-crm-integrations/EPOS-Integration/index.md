## EPOS Systems using the Collins API  

We can give EPOS systems access to the Collins API. This will enable them to pull specific data from Collins for example, any pre-paid deposits.  

**The following EPOS systems currently access our API:**

* Polaris
* Lightspeed

To get either of the above integrations set up, please contact your Collins Account Manager.

## How to set up access to the Collins API

**We are able to give access to the following API endpoints:**

* [Bookings](http://developers.designmynight.com/api/booking-api) - this will pull the booking data from your Collins Enquiries Page (ie every field you can see on your [CSV download from enquiry page](https://collins.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/1829035-enquiries-page-csv-download))
* [Users](http://developers.designmynight.com/api/users-api/) - this will pull your Collins Customers Data
* Bookings Reports - this will pull your booking reports with whichever parameters you wish
* Venues - this will pull your DMN Venue reviews
* [Offers](http://developers.designmynight.com/api/offers-api/) - this will pull your Collins Offers (and can be used to check which offers are eligible for a given booking)

If you are looking to get API access for your EPOS system, the first step is for the Account Manager at your EPOS system to have a look through our [API Basics for Developers](http://developers.designmynight.com/api/api-basics/).

If you would then like to proceed, please contact your Collins Account Manager.

You will then be given the following:

* User ID
* API Key
* Base url: https://api.designmynight.com/v4/
* Docs: [developers.designmynight.com](http://developers.designmynight.com/api-basics/)

It will then be up to your EPOS system to access our API and pull the relevant data.
