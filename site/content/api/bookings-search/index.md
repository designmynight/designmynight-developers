The DesignMyNight Booking search can be used to list and search through a venue's bookings.

## Overview

Queries are carried out as GET requests to the bookings API endpoint. To start with, you can try this with no parameters:

```bash
$ curl -X GET https://api.designmynight.com/v4/bookings
```

You'll get a response like this, containing a list of bookings.
```json
{
  "payload": {
    "bookings": [
      {
        ...
      },
      {
        ...
      }
    ],
    "start": 0,
    "numFound": 105320
  },
  "status": 200,
  "requestTime": "2016-04-29T10:06:01",

For example, the following request will only output the labels and status of bookings:

```bash
$ curl -X GET https://api.designmynight.com/v4/bookings?fields=labels,status
```

## Pagination

The response from each request includes a `numFound` property that tells you the total number of matching bookings for the given query. By default, the API will start at 0 (the first matching result) and will return 30 results per request. This can be changed using the following parameters:

Parameter | Description
----- | -----
`start` | The zero-based index of the first result to be included in the results. Default: 0
`limit` | The maximum number of results to be included in the results. Default: 30

For example, to include the third 'page' of results with 50 per 'page', you would use:

```bash
$ curl -X GET https://api.designmynight.com/v4/bookings?start=100&limit=50
```

## Sorting

The response can be sorted using the `sort` parameter, using one of the allowed sorting options:

Option | Description | Direction
--- | --- | ---
`date_asc` | The date of the booking | Ascending
`date_desc` | The date of the booking | Descending
`created_date_asc` | The date the booking was made | Ascending
`created_date_desc` | The date the booking was made | Descending
`status_changed_date` | The date the status was last changed | Descending
`date_desc,time_desc` | The date and time of the booking | Descending

For example, the following request would sort bookings in order of the date their status was last changed, in descending order:

```bash
$ curl -X GET https://api.designmynight.com/v4/bookings?sort=status_changed_date
```

## Filtering results

You can search and filter through the entire list of bookings by passing additional parameters. The following search parameters are currently available:

```

or to search for private hire bookings which that take place in February 2018:

```bash
$ curl -X GET https://api.designmynight.com/v4/bookings?private_hire=true&date=2018-02-01%20TO%202018-02-28
```

### Specifying return fields

You can limit the fields that are returned in the response using the `fields` parameter, and specifying the name of the fields you would like to return as the value. To return multiple specific fields, the names can be comma separated.

For example, to only bring back the `estimated_value` of a booking, you can use:

```bash
$ curl -X GET https://api.designmynight.com/v4/bookings?fields=estimated_value
```

or to bring back the booking date and number of guests, you could use:

```bash
$ curl -X GET https://api.designmynight.com/v4/bookings?fields=date,num_people
```

### Date filter format
Dates may be filtered by providing a range, optionally using an asterisk to carry out an open-ended search. A number of date formats are supported, but to ensure accuracy the recommended date format is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss, eg 2017-02-15T13:45:00. If the time is omitted, midnight (the start of the day) will be assumed.

Examples:

Parameter | Description
----- | -----
date=2017-02-15 | Match bookings with this exact date
last_updated=2016-12-15T13:45:00 TO * | Match bookings that have been updated since this time
created_date=* TO 2016-12-31T23:59:59 | Match bookings that were created before this time
