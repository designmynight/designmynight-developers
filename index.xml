      <description>Updating your Email Settings If you are using our Collins Mail bolt-on, you do not have to action the below.
For all other clients, you need to explicitly say that Collins is allowed to send emails for your domain/on your behalf.
This is the only way that we can guarantee that emails deliver correctly to you and customers.
The most common way of doing this is to set up an &amp;lsquo;SPF record&amp;rsquo; and DKIM for your domain (@yourvenue.</description>

      <description>Booking Widget Documentation Introduction The widget is applied to a page by including the &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; tag. This can be generated using the Widget Wizard within Collins, or you can manually piece the tag together.
Attributes on the &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; tag allow you to specify options at run time, but you can also use the Javascript API to set options and control state.
The stylesheet must be included as well as the script tag to style the widget.</description>

      <description>API Troubleshooting If you are using our API and think that something is not working correctly, we will require both the full request and full response from your web developer before we can look into it for you:

      <description>Booking URL for a specific venue If you are unable to add the Collins booking widget, it&amp;rsquo;s possible for you to include a booking URL to your website instead.
Here is an example of partners using a booking URL: The Park Tavern
To create a booking URL for your venue, you will need to use a URL of the following form:
https://www.designmynight.com/book?venue_id=VENUEID&amp;amp;source=partner&amp;amp;format=modal
Where you have to replace &amp;lsquo;VENUEID&amp;rsquo; with your unique Collins Venue ID.</description>

      <description>Updating your Email Settings If you are using our Collins Mail bolt-on, you do not have to action the below.
For all other clients, you need to explicitly say that Collins is allowed to send emails for your domain/on your behalf.
This is the only way that we can guarantee that emails deliver correctly to you and customers.
The most common way of doing this is to set up an &amp;lsquo;SPF record&amp;rsquo; and DKIM for your domain (@yourvenue.</description>
