      <description>Updating your Email Settings If you are not using Collins Mail you will need to make a slight update to your email settings to say that Collins is allowed to send emails for your Domain/on your behalf.
This is the only way to guarantee that emails from Collins, confirmation/cancellation emails for example, deliver correctly to/from you and your customers.
If this is not completed, Collins will not be able to send any outbound emails for you.</description>
