      <description>API Troubleshooting If you are using our API and think that something is not working correctly, we will require both the full request and full response from your web developer before we can look into it for you:
 Full Request - example here Full Response - example here  This is so that our tech team can effectively look into the issue for you. Without the above, we will not be able to assist.</description>

      <description>Booking URL for a specific venue If you are unable to add the Collins booking widget, it&amp;rsquo;s possible for you to include a booking URL to your website instead.
Here is an example of partners using a booking URL: The Park Tavern
To create a booking URL for your venue, you will need to use a URL of the following form:
https://www.designmynight.com/book?venue_id=VENUEID&amp;amp;source=partner&amp;amp;format=modal
Where you have to replace &amp;lsquo;VENUEID&amp;rsquo; with your unique Collins Venue ID.</description>

      <description>Tracking There are 3 ways you can look at tracking:
Google/Facebook Tracking Putting Google/Facebook code on the first enquire button in the CSS (this isn&amp;rsquo;t tracking to completion but the drop off rate is about 10% on average from loading up the iframe so a quick and easy way to get a pretty accurate reading).

      <description>Updating your Email Settings If you are using our Collins Mail bolt-on, you do not have to action the below.
For all other clients, you need to explicitly say that Collins is allowed to send emails for your domain/on your behalf.
This is the only way that we can guarantee that emails deliver correctly to you and customers.
The most common way of doing this is to set up an &amp;lsquo;SPF record&amp;rsquo; and DKIM for your domain (@yourvenue.</description>
